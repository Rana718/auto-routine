1. Business Context
The client operates a procurement operation.
* They receive customer orders from online malls (via the Robot-in order management system).
* Their staff must physically visit multiple retail stores to purchase the ordered items.
* Each day, hundreds of different items must be bought from 200–300 possible stores.
* Staff members travel between stores, so store selection and routing efficiency is critical.
In this context, “purchase” means physically buying products from real-world stores, not online checkout.

2. Current Manual Workflow (Before System)
1. Download order data from Robot-in
2. Open Excel
3. Manually:
   * Split items by purchase location
   * Assign items to staff
   * Decide which store to visit
   * Create routes by experience/intuition
4. Staff travel and purchase items
5. If an item cannot be purchased:
   * Manually record “discontinued / out of stock / restock date”
This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and hard to scale, especially during peak periods.

3. Target System Workflow (After System)
Step 1: Order Data Input
* Automatically import order data from:
   * Robot-in (initially)
   * Online mall APIs (future)
* Input fields:
   * SKU
   * Product name
   * Quantity
   * Order date
________________


Step 2: Product Processing
* Detect set/bundle products
* Split them into individual items at list creation time
* Mark items that:
   * Should be excluded from routing
   * Are store-fixed vs multi-store eligible
________________


Step 3: Store Selection Logic
For each item:
* Identify candidate stores (1 or multiple)
* Evaluate stores based on:
   * Distance
   * Business rules / priority
   * Store availability
* Select the most suitable store for the day’s route
________________


Step 4: Daily Cutoff Handling
* Orders before 13:10 → today’s purchase list
* Orders after cutoff → next business day
* Weekends & holidays:
   * Normally excluded
   * Can be overridden during busy periods
________________


Step 5: Staff Assignment
* Automatically assign items and stores to 5–6 staff members
* Staff count may grow up to 10
* Start point:
   * Office (default)
   * Or on-site store start (optional per day)
________________


Step 6: Route Optimization
For each staff member:
* Generate an optimized visiting order of assigned stores
* Prioritize:
   * Speed
   * Practical efficiency (near-optimal, not mathematically perfect)
* Display:
   * Map view (required)
   * Editable route order (preferred)
________________


Step 7: Purchase Result Management
If an item cannot be purchased:
* Mark status as:
   * Discontinued
   * Out of stock
   * Restock scheduled
* Allow manual entry of restock date
________________


Step 8: User & Admin Management
* Account-based access
* Admin can:
   * Manage user accounts
   * Edit data
   * Override decisions if needed
________________


4. Inputs and Outputs
Inputs
* Order data (SKU, product name, quantity)
* Store master data (200–300 stores)
* Staff data (users, start locations)
* Business rules (cutoff time, holidays)
* Manual inputs (restock dates, exclusions)
________________


Outputs
* Daily purchase list (by staff)
* Selected purchase store per item
* Optimized route per staff (map + list)
* Purchase status tracking (success / failure / restock)
* Scalable data for future automation

5. System Goal 
To fully automate daily purchase planning—from order intake to store selection, staff assignment, and route generation—so that large-scale physical procurement can be executed quickly, accurately, and with minimal manual work.
